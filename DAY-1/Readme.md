# 🌐 Day 1: Introduction to Web Development

## 🎯 Objective
Understand how the web works, what web development involves, and the tools used by developers.

## 🔹 What is Web Development?

Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites. It includes three major areas:

### 🚀 Front-End Development
- What users see and interact with
- Technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**

### 🧠 Back-End Development
- Server-side logic, databases, and APIs
- Technologies: **Node.js**, **Python**, **PHP**, etc.

### 🔄 Full-Stack Development
- A combination of both front-end and back-end development

**📝 Activity:**  
Watch an introductory video on web development and reflect on how websites are built.

## 🔹 How the Web Works

Understand the flow of data from client to server:

- **Client:** The browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- **Server:** Hosts and serves the website
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Converts domain names to IP addresses
- **HTTP/HTTPS Protocol:** Handles the communication between browser and server
- **Request-Response Cycle:**  
  The browser sends a request ➡️ the server responds with the web page data.

**💡 Mini Exercise:**  
Open DevTools (Right Click → Inspect → Network Tab) and observe how resources are loaded when you visit a website.

## 🔹 Front-End vs Back-End

| Front-End                | Back-End                          |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| HTML, CSS, JavaScript   | Python, Node.js, PHP, etc.        |
| What the user sees      | Logic, data processing, APIs      |
| UI/UX focused           | Security, data storage            |

**🧠 Discussion Prompt:**  
Think of a website you use frequently. Identify which parts are front-end (e.g., design, buttons) and which parts are back-end (e.g., login logic, data retrieval).

## 🔹 Introduction to HTML & CSS

### 📄 HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- Defines the structure of a web page

### 🎨 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- Adds styling: layout, colors, fonts, spacing

**🖥️ Live Demo:**  
Create a simple HTML page and apply CSS to style it.

## 🔹 Tools for Web Development

- **Text Editor:** Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Web Browser:** Use Google Chrome
- **File Management:** Create and organize `.html` and `.css` files
- **Developer Tools:** Use Chrome DevTools to inspect and debug

**🛠️ Activity Checklist:**

- [ ] Install VS Code  
- [ ] Create a project folder  
- [ ] Create your first `index.html`  
- [ ] Add basic HTML structure  
- [ ] Open in browser and view

### 🏠 Homework
1. ✍️ **Explain in your own words:**  
   How does a website load when you enter a URL in your browser?

2. 🌐 **Explore:**  
   Visit **3 websites** and observe:
