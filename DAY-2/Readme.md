## 🔹 What is HTML?

HTML (**HyperText Markup Language**) is the standard language used to structure content on the web.

- It is a **markup language**, not a programming language.
- Uses **tags** like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`, etc., to define elements.
- Tags are typically enclosed in **opening** and **closing** pairs.

📌 **Example:**
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

## 🔹 Basic HTML Document Structure

All HTML documents follow a common structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page using HTML.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 📝 Description of Each Element:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML (HTML5 in this case).
- `<html>`: The root element that wraps the entire HTML content.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information such as the title, character set, styles, and links to resources (not displayed on the webpage).
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the page, which appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains all the visible content on the web page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.
