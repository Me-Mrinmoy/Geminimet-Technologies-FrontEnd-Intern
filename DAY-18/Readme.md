### ðŸ”¹ Introduction

On Day 17, you focused on creating the base HTML structure for your website, including the header, navigation, main content, and footer. Now, itâ€™s time to enhance this structure visually. This dayâ€™s focus is on applying CSS styles to your HTML structure to make it visually appealing, readable, and usable across different screen sizes.

You will begin by applying basic CSS styles to elements like the header, body, and sections. You will then proceed to implement responsive design techniques using media queries and CSS layout methods such as Flexbox and Grid to ensure that your website looks good on various devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, desktops).
